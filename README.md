### Using Liberty as an MCP Server and Python Client to Test

---

This example demonstrates the versatility of Liberty as a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, capable of exposing RESTful endpoints that reuse a common set of business logic components. The MCP server is deployed on Liberty running on Java 11 or later, while the corresponding client, responsible for enumerating available MCP tools and invoking REST operations, is implemented in Python, highlighting Libertyâ€™s interoperability and multi-language integration capabilities.

Steps:
1. Liberty as an MCP and REST server
2. Python client
