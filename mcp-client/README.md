### Python MCP and REST client 

---

The client will list the available MCP tools, invoke the tool and then invoke the REST endpoint

1. Make sure the code is cloned and that you are in the `mcp-client` directory
2. Make sure you have python version 3.1x on your system
```
python3 --version
```
2. Create a virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
3. Add the necessary dependencies
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
4. run the tool, after the server is started
 ```
python3 main.py
```
